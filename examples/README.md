## Example

This is intended to be an example of how a project might install the package and automate the running of it with GitHub Actions.

It has been made to be a very stripped down implementation.

To see a real world implementation, which at its core is this example but with more optimization around the workflow and a more robust run script, see [macpro-base-template's implementation](REPLACEME)
